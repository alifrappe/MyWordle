## Description
Wordle is a daily word guessing game created by the New York Times.

The rules are simple: every day, the player has six tries to find a five letters word, by making guesses and finding hints.
Each guess must be a valid five-letters word.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
